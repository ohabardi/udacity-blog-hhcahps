# 📊 What Drives Patient Recommendations in Home Health Care?

This project is part of the **Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree**, focused on data storytelling and insight generation using real-world health care survey data.

## 🏥 Project Overview

This analysis explores what factors influence whether patients **recommend a home health agency** based on data from the **Home Health Care Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HHCAHPS)**.

Using the **CRISP-DM process**, I examined over 12,000 agencies in the U.S. to understand which aspects of care (communication, professionalism, safety, etc.) matter most to patients.

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

1. **What factors are most strongly correlated with patient recommendation?**
2. **Do survey response rate or number of surveys affect quality ratings?**
3. **Which service area performs best across all agencies?**

## 📈 Summary of Findings

- **Overall patient rating and communication quality** were the strongest predictors of whether patients would recommend an agency.
- The **number of completed surveys** had little to no impact on ratings.
- **Professional care** received the highest average rating, while discussions around **medicines, pain, and safety** scored lower — revealing an area for improvement.
